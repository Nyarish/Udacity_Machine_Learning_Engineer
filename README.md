# Machine Learning Engineer

Learn advanced machine learning deployment techniques and software engineering best practices.

## Course 1: Software Engineering Fundamentals
In this lesson, you’ll write production-level code and practice object-oriented programming, which you can integrate into machine learning projects.

- Lesson 1: Software Engineering Practices
- Lesson 2: Programming
- Lesson 3: Upload a Package to PyPI

## Project: Build a Python Package
```
This program is all about understanding how to build machine learning algorithms and prepare them for
scalable, production systems. A first step towards building these systems is to gain an understanding of
writing production level code, which you have the option of doing by writing a Python package of your own.

Key Skills Demonstrated:
    • Object-oriented programming
    • Clean and modular code
    • Code documentation

```

## Course 2: Machine Learning in Production
Learn how to deploy machine learning models to a production environment using Amazon SageMaker.

- Lesson 1: Introduction to Deployment
- Lesson 2: Deploy a Model
- Lesson 3: Web Hosting
- Lesson 4: Model Monitoring
- Lesson 5: Updating a Model

## Project: Deploy a Sentiment Analysis Model
```
In this project, you will be provided a dataset reflecting data collected from an experiment. You’ll use
statistical techniques to answer questions about the data and report your conclusions and recommendations in a report.
Key Skills Demonstrated:
    • Text analysis
    • Model deployment via SageMaker
    • APIs for web deployment
```
## Course 3: Machine Learning Case Studies
Apply machine learning techniques to solve real-world tasks; explore data and deploy both built-in and custom-made Amazon SageMaker models.

- Lesson 1: Population Segmentation with SageMaker
- Lesson 2: Detecting Credit Card Fraud
- Lesson 3: Deploying Custom Models
- Lesson 4: Model Monitoring
- Lesson 5: Time-Series Forecasting

## Project: Plagiarism Detector
```
Use your machine learning skills to compare two text sources and identify cases of plagiarism. In this project, you will extract relevant text features and train a model of your own design to do plagiarism detection. Then, you will deploy your trained model using Amazon SageMaker.
Key Skills Demonstrated:
    • Feature engineering
    • Model design and evaluation
    • Model deployment via SageMaker

```

## Course 4: Machine Learning Capstone
In this capstone lesson, you’ll select a machine learning challenge and propose a possible solution.

- Lesson 1: Elective 1: Starbucks
- Lesson 2: Elective 2: Arvato Financial Services
- Lesson 3: Elective 3: Convolutional Neural Network
- Lesson 4: Elective 4: Your Choice

## Project: Capstone Proposal and Project
```
In this capstone project, you will leverage what you’ve learned throughout the program to build a machine
learning project of your choosing. You will define the problem you want to solve, investigate and explore the
data, identify and explore the data, then perform your analyses and develop a set of conclusions. You will
present the analysis and your conclusions in a blog post and GitHub repository. This project will serve as a
demonstration of your ability as a machine learning engineer, and will be an important piece of your job
ready portfolio.
Key Skills Demonstrated:
• All of the machine learning workflow, from data exploration to
model training and evaluation
```
