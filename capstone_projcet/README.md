Customer Segmentation Using Data and Machine Learning Algorithms For Arvato Financial Solutions

This project is based on real-life data science problem provided by Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics.In this project we are provided with demographic datasets of customers of a mail-order company in Germany, and demographic data of the general population of Germany.

The mission of the project is to make predictions based on data and machine learning algorithms on individuals who are mostly likely to become customers for a mail order sales company in Germany, instead of solely relying on gut feeling and intuition from senior experienced managers.

Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

Prerequisites

This project requires Python 3.x and the following Python libraries installed:

NumPy - A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
Pandas - A library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools.
ScikitLearn - Simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis
Matplotlib - Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms
Sea Born - Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
boto3 - Boto is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) SDK for Python. It enables Python developers to create, configure, and manage AWS services, such as EC2 and S3. Boto provides an easy to use, object-oriented API, as well as low-level access to AWS services.
SageMaker - SageMaker Python SDK is an open source library for training and deploying machine learning models on Amazon SageMaker.
You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.
